# Holidaze - Project Exam 2

This repository contains the second-year exam project for a booking site called Holidaze. The goal was to develop a fully functional venue booking platform using React and Styled Components, interacting with a provided API for data handling. The site is fully responsive, ensuring smooth functionality across all screen sizes.

## Project Overview

This project involved designing and developing a responsive web application for a fictional accommodation booking service called Holidaze. The project was built following a detailed brief that included multiple user stories and required implementing the following core functionalities:

- **Browse and search for venues**: Fetched from API
- **View details of a specific venue**: Using dynamic routing
- **Check availability through a calendar function**
- **User authentication system**: Restricted to specific domains
- **User dashboard to manage bookings**
- **Venue manager role**: Allows adding, editing, and deleting venues
- **Manage bookings as a venue owner**
- **Update profile avatar for registered users**

Additionally, a set of technical constraints was outlined for the project:

1. **Use a recognized JavaScript framework**: React.js was chosen
2. **Use a CSS-in-JS solution**: Styled Components implemented
3. **Host the site on an approved static host**: Deployed on Netlify
4. **Use a design application for UI/UX**: Designed with Figma
